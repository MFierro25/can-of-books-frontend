## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->



Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. We built a web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.
